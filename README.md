> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator


## Getting Started

### Porject Goal

Supply a yeoman generator for Ravello's angular projects

```

```

### Ngravello Generator

Ngravello generator is very light. The app generator also optionally installs Bootstrap and additional AngularJS modules, such as angular-resource (installed by default).

To install generator-ngravello from npm, run:

```
$ npm install -g generator-ngravello
```

Make a new directory, and cd into it:
```
$ mkdir ravello-new-ng-project && cd $_
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```
$ yo ngravello
```

### Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced.

If you'd like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).
